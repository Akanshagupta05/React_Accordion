        question: 'What are the components in React?',

        question: 'What is React? Why Use It?',

        question: 'What is JSX?',
        answer: 'JSX is a way of building React user interfaces that uses the simple syntax of HTML, but adds the functionality and dynamic nature of JavaScript.In short, it is HTML + JavaScript for structuring our React apps.'
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: 'What is the difference between state and props?',
        answer: 'States are values we can read and update in our React components.Props are values that are passed to React components and are read only (they should not be updated).You can think of props as being similar to arguments for a function that exist outside of our components, while state are values that change over time, but exist and are declared inside our components.'
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        question: 'What are React Fragments used for?',
        answer: 'React fragments are a special feature in React that let you write group children elements or components without creating an actual node in the DOM.The fragment syntax looks like an empty set of tags <></> or are tags labeled React.Fragment.In simpler terms, sometimes we need to put multiple React elements under a single parent, but we dont want to use a generic HTML element like a div.'
